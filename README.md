# Protein Folding Simulation on a 2D Lattice
This project simulates the folding process of proteins on a 2D lattice. It uses a simplified model to demonstrate the effects of hydrophobic interactions and sterical constraints during protein folding. The simulation employs methods like move generation, energy calculation, and simulated annealing to explore possible configurations of the protein.
